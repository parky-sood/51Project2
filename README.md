# Out-of-order RISC-V CPU Simulator

**Description**:

In this project, you will design an out-of-order RISC-V processor using
C++. 

The ISA of this processor is the standard RV32-I base extension.

The processor implementation consists of two parts:
* The CPU emulator: decode and execute instructions to generate instruction trace.
* The CPU simulator: Use the instruction trace to perform cycle-level simulation.

The project is divided into 2 parts:

## Part 1 : Out-of-oder pipeline
A five-stage pipeline for the processor to execute instructions, and output the trace of which instructions are in the pipeline at any given time.

## Part 2 : Gshare predictor
The processor's branch predictor is a GShare predictor containing an 8-bit BHR and 256-entry BHT, matched with a 256-entry BTB.
Assume all counters, including the BHR to be initialized to zero at boot.
The implementation of the GShare class is done via the predict() method.
Note that we are only interested in timing.
Your GShare's predict() method should first determine the current predicted outcome, and then update the predictor.
also note that a successful prediction is a combination of branch direction and branch target hits.

## Testing your code
use command line option (-s) to enable display of CPU performance stats.
The CPU simulator was added two command line options to activate gshare (-g) or the out-of-order processor (-o).
Not passing any option will simply enable the baseline in-order CPU pipeline without gshare.

The provided Makefile contains a `test` command to execute all provided tests.

    $ make test     # baseline
    $ make test-o   # ooo CPU enabled
    $ make test-g   # gshare enabled
    $ make test-og  # ooo CPU and gshare enabled 

All tests are under the /tests/ folder.
You can execute an individual test by running:

    $ ./tinyrv -s tests/rv32ui-p-sub.hex
    $ ./tinyrv -so tests/rv32ui-p-sub.hex
    $ ./tinyrv -sg tests/rv32ui-p-sub.hex
    $ ./tinyrv -sog tests/rv32ui-p-sub.hex

If a test succeeds, you will get "PASSED!" output message.

## Debugging your code
You need to build the project with DEBUG=```LEVEL``` where level varies from 0 to 5.
That will turn on the debug trace inside the code and show you what the processor is doing and some of its internal states.

    $ make clean
    $ DEBUG=3 make
    $ ./tinyrv -s tests/rv32ui-p-sub.hex

## Build instructions
* run ```make``` at the root of the project to build the simulator

        $ make

* A linux development environment is needed to build the project
* We recommend using a Ubuntu 18.04 or above distribution
* This C++ project requires C++ 11 to compile and it should come installed on Ubuntu 18.04 or above

## Guidelines
* Do not modify the following files: Makefile, main.cpp
* Do not modify the following directories: common
* If needed it is ok to add new files to the code or modify other parts of the codebase.
* Do not remove an existing file from the project.
* Do not change the Makefile, you can always add a new file as a header. Make sure to include the new file under the **src/** folder.

## Understanding the codebase
The codebase contains the following important files:
- Makefile: your build makefile
- config.h: the processor configuration file
- debug.h: the application debugging layer
- main.cpp: implements the application's main() entry point where the command line is parsed and the processor class is instantiated. This is also where the simulation loop is executed.
- processor.cpp: implements the processor class which contains a single core.
- core.cpp: implements the CPU simulator pipeline.
- decode.cpp: implements the emulator's instruction decode
- execute.cpp: implements emulator's instruction execution
- instr.h: implements the emulator's decoded instruction class
- pipeline.h: implements the simulator pipeline state and pipeline latches
- type.h: implements processor data structures
- common/*: implements utility libraries

When the application execute, the ```Core::tick()``` function is invoked every cycle and that is where the 5 stages of the pipeline execute. The ```if_stage()``` invokes the emulator's ```Emulator::step()``` function to obtain the current pipeline trace to simulate. Internally, the emulator ```Emulator::step()``` function will invoke ```Emulator::decode()```, and then ```Emulator::execute()``` to construct the pipeline trace.

The default implementation of the simulator is to simply forward the instruction data (```pipeline_trace```) to next stage without any stall. The test program will PASSED, but the timing will be incorrect since this design ignores stalls caused by data and control hazards.
